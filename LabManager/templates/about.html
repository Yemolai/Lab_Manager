            <p class="mb-4">Welcome to the Laborator.io app.</p>

            <p class="mb-4">This is a web application designed to help with overall
                administration of scientific laboratories.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">The app is currently in development phase, and once ready
                will be capable of automating tasks such as personnel
                frequency, equipment inventory, and organization of field
                expeditions.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">The application will also provide basic utilities such as
                a calendar with user-inputed events, a notice board for
                sharing of important announcements among personnel, as
                well as a configurable news feed.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">This app is being developed using the Flask framework
                for Python 3.6+.
            </p>

            <p>The source code is available at GitHub, on
                <a href="https://github.com/Fayhen/Lab_Manager" target="_blank">this repository</a>.
